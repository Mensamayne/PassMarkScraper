## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### ðŸŽ® Added - Gaming & Recommendation System

#### New Features
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Intelligent CPU+GPU pairing analysis with bottleneck detection
- **Game Categories**: Analysis across 4 game types (E-sport, AAA GPU-heavy, Balanced, Simulation)
- **Smart Recommendations**: Component pairing recommendations based on game focus
- **Gaming Profiles**: Complete performance breakdown by game category and resolution
- **Performance Estimates**: FPS predictions for different games, resolutions, and settings
- **Balance Scoring**: 0-100 compatibility score for CPU+GPU pairings
- **Minimum Requirements**: Prevents absurd pairings (e.g., Threadripper + GTX 1030)

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /analyze-pairing` - Analyze CPU+GPU compatibility
- `GET /recommend-pairing` - Get component recommendations
- `POST /gaming-profile` - Complete gaming performance profile
- `GET /estimate-performance` - Performance estimates for single component
- `GET /game-categories` - List all game categories

#### Core Components
- `app/recommendation.py` - Recommendation engine with balancing algorithms
- `app/gaming_profiles.py` - Game category configs and performance estimation
- New Pydantic models for recommendation endpoints
- Comprehensive test suite (22 new tests)
- Example demo script (`examples/recommendation_demo.py`)

#### Technical Details
- Multi-tier validation system (minimum requirements, tier matching, score balance)
- Weighted analysis across game categories (25% E-sport, 35% AAA, 25% Balanced, 15% Simulation)
- FPS estimation based on PassMark scores with resolution/settings multipliers
- CPU/GPU utilization prediction per game category

### Changed
- Updated README with new features and examples
- API version bumped to 2.0.0
- Enhanced root endpoint with feature listing
- Updated main.py with 5 new endpoints

### Documentation
